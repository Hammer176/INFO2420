<h1>Information Systems &amp; Technology FAQs</h1>
<p>The IS/IT Department is in the process of developing a comprehensive list of frequently</p>
<p>asked questions and answers for our students.   If you don't see an answer to your question</p>
<p>below please email your question to the IS/IT advisor: Candace Lavaka - <a href="mailto:candace.lavaka@uvu.edu">candace.lavaka@uvu.edu</a></p>


<hr/><h2>Question: How is IS/IT different from Computer Science?</h2>
<p>Answer: To be sure there is a degree of overlap between these disciplines.</p>
<p>Both study computer hardware and software. Computer Science studies in depth the internal</p>
<p>operations of computers and the development of systems software to make computers easy to use.</p>
<p>IS/IT, on the other hand, is concerned more with the users and business uses of computers than</p>
<p>with the computers themselves. IS/IT requires a moderate-level of programming and a little</p>
<p>hardware knowledge; however, its primary focus is on using the technology to meet business needs.</p>


<hr/><h2>Question: How do I test out of a class?</h2>
<p>Answer: Follow this process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the IS/IT Department office in CS 601 and visit with the IS/IT office administrator, Cheryl Levi.</li>
  <li>Ask her to complete the request for test out online form.</li>
  <li>Arrange with the faculty member currently teaching the class to take the exam.</li>
  <li>Pay a $15 test out fee at the UVU Cashier window.</li>
  <li>Take the exam. Some exams may require more than one step.</li>
  <li>The instructor will notify you and the office administrator if you have passed.</li>
  <li>Visit the office administrator again to decide if you want to buy the credits.</li>
  <li>Pay $5 per credit at the UVU cashier if you choose to buy them.</li>
  <li>The office administrator will then complete your online test out form.</li>
</ol>

<hr/><h2>Question: What is the IS/IT lab fee used for?</h2>
<p>Answer: All fees go toward maintaining state-of-the-art hardware and software technology</p>
<p>for your use while at school and for printing up to 200 pages from the lab computers.</p>
<p>We have found that student's who request a refund of the fee soon wish that they hadn't,</p>
<p>so please take advantage of this great service. There are no waiting lines to use the</p>
<p>School of Technology and Computing.</p>

<p>Student Testimonial:</p>
<p>"I have found it very helpful to clarify questions I have in the program before making decisions</p>
<p>like deciding on what classes to take in what order.  I would hate to have made a bad guess and</p>
<p>spend an entire semester in a course I did not need to graduate.  If my advisor is not available,</p>
<p>I try to check these FAQs to see if the answer to my question is here." Jane Doe </p>
