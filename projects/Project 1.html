    <ol>
        <li><strong>First Impression:</strong> The Trader Joe’s website gave me a welcoming and quirky vibe right off the bat. It matchs the brand's in store feel casual, colorful, and fun.</li>

        <li><strong>Information Flow:</strong> The layout places a navigation bar at the top with dropdown menus. The homepage has a prominent banner and content sections organized vertically. It felt intuitive and easy to explore.</li>

        <li><strong>Site Structure:</strong> Yes, the structure makes sense. Everything is where you’d expect it, and the categories are clear. There’s no confusion about how to get to the product pages or recipes.</li>

        <li><strong>Graphics/Layout/Multimedia:</strong> The design is friendly and visually consistent with their brand. The graphics and illustrations enhance the site, making it feel lighthearted without being overwhelming.</li>

        <li><strong>Load Time:</strong> The homepage loaded in about 2–3 seconds. That’s perfectly reasonable and didn’t impact my experience at all.</li>

        <li><strong>Text and Background:</strong> The text is readable, and the font choices fit the Trader Joe’s aesthetic. The background is clean and neutral, helping the text stand out. No readability issues.</li>

        <li><strong>Navigation Tools:</strong> Yes, there’s a clear navigation bar and search function. Both worked well and made it easy to find specific content.</li>

        <li><strong>Color Scheme:</strong> Absolutely. The look and feel carry across every page with warm tones, hand drawn elements, and consistent branding make it all feel cohesive.</li>

        <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> On smaller screens, the site adapts well. Thee menu collapses into a mobile friendly version, and content stacks vertically without breaking. Some navigation tools do move slightly but its not a big problem.</li>

        <li><strong>Something Well Done or Unusual:</strong> The way they integrate recipes and store information in a fun, engaging way stood out. It’s not just a grocery site, it’s part food guide and part brand story which over all adds a lot to it. It doesnt feel soules.</li>
